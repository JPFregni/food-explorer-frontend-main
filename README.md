## üöÄ How it works

This project is divided into two parts:

1. Backend (food-explorer-backend folder)
2. Frontend (food-explorer-frontend folder)

üí° The Frontend needs the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/). In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### üé≤ Running the Server (Backend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:JPFregni/food-explorer-backend.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd food-explorer-backend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# run the migration and seed
$ npm migrate
$ npm seed

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# Admin login
$ email: admin@email.com
$ password: 090807

# The Server will start at port: 3333 - go to http://localhost:3333
```

---

#### üß≠ Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:JPFregni/food-explorer-frontend.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd food-explorer-frontend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000
```
